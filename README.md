# Data Automation ~ Library Client

## Day 1
Task:
1. Load in the data via a jupyter notebook.
2. Explore the data, clean and visualise.
3. Output cleaned data files.

Stretch: 
Look intot the SQLALCHEMY library and try to get python to write the cleaned files to a local SQL Server. #

## Day 2:

- Create a .py file based on your work yesterday to CLEAN and OUTPUT the library datasets. 
- You must include functions like the following:
    - fileLoader
    - duplicateChecker
    - naChecker
    - dataEnrich 

### PM: Tasks

1. Make sure you have a function that calculates the difference between the time the books were on loan to when they were checked out. 
2. Check my solutions.

Stretch Tasks (speak to Nirosh first):
- Use the Argparse library to toggle the writing to SQL on and off. 
- Using APIs:
    - Find an open API and write a new pyton script that requests data from an API and prints it.
